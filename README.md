 # Touchpad Joystick

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
This is a touch sensitive joystick designed be Ron Nelson intended to be used with the Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC). This device is a more affordable option to many commercial joysticks and trackpads on the market. This is a USB joystick that can be plugged into either the left, or right USB joystick of the XAC.

## Getting Started
<!--- 
Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.
 --->

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Touchpad_Joystick_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Touchpad Joystick. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. 

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components for the switch tester case and choose an option for the case.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Touchpad Joystick
Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Touchpad_Joystick_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
