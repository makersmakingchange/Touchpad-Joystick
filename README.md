# Touchpad Joystick

<!-- SUMMARY -->
The Touchpad Joystick is a joystick that is activated by touch. This device is a more affordable option to many commercial joysticks and trackpads on the market. This is a USB joystick that can be plugged into either the left, or right USB joystick of the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

The Touchpad Joystick is comprised of a commercially available capacitive touch sensor (Cirque Capacitive Touch Sensor 35 mm) that is mounted in a 3d printed enclosure.

This Joystick was designed by Ron Nelson.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Touchpad_Joystick_BOM.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Touchpad Joystick. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. 

### 2. Print the 3D Printable components
Print the components for the switch tester case and choose an option for the case.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 3. Assemble the Touchpad Joystick
Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Touchpad_Joystick_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
